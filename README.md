# hi hello

this is my profile and it's definitely a sight to behold. if you ever have the displeasure of meeting me in real life, please give me high fantasy books

I know JS (Currently learning TS because of suicidal thoughts arising), CSS, HTML, and a wee tad bit of Python (when I mean "wee tad bit", I mean infinitesimal)

I also know actual languages but those don't really matter here. 

性格を「日本が好きですか。」ってする人は大っ嫌いです。マジで黙れ。
