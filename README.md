I know JS (Currently learning TS because of suicidal thoughts arising), CSS, HTML, and a wee tad bit of Python (when I mean "wee tad bit", I mean infinitesimal)

If my code looks a tad yucky, that's because I am currently relearning it (I shall forever say this even when I can code somewhat well)

## facts about me

socially brain dead.

former (and probably still) always nester.

knows three languages (like real languages) and aspires to learn 5.

will most likely get glasses in 6 months. 

can code for 6 hours straight without getting anything accomplished. 

よろしくお願いします。
