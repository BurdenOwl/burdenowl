# hi hello, good meeting thee

this is my profile and it's definitely a sight to behold. if you ever have the displeasure of meeting me in real life, please give me high fantasy books, and Milk Tea or Coffee (Black is fine, albeit a tad 苦い)

for whatever reason one wishes talk to me, one can do that by contacting me through Discord. Just send me a friend request at BurdenOwl (same username as GitHub)

+ JavaScript (Main Language)
+ TypeScript (Currently Learning)
+ HTML
+ CSS
+ Python (Little bit and now started learning)

If my code looks a tad yucky, that's because I am currently relearning it (I shall forever say this even when I can code somewhat well)

## facts about me

+ Socially brain dead.
+ Former (and probably still) always nester.
+ Knows three languages (like real languages) and aspires to learn 5.
+ Will most likely get glasses in 6 months. 
+ Can code for 6 hours straight without getting anything accomplished. 

よろしくお願いします。
