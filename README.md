# hi hello, good meeting thee

this is my profile and it's definitely a sight to behold. if you ever have the displeasure of meeting me in real life, please give me high fantasy books

I know JS (Currently learning TS because of suicidal thoughts arising), CSS, HTML, and a wee tad bit of Python (when I mean "wee tad bit", I mean infinitesimal)

If my code looks a tad yucky, that's because I am currently relearning it (I shall forever say this even when I can code somewhat well)

I also know actual languages but those don't really matter here. 

よろしくお願いします。
